    <h2>Zombie, Run! Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <p><i>Q:</i> How do you move around the map?<br />
       <i>A:</i> Grab your device, and go outside.  The blue dot representing your location is your
       <u>actual</u> location, based on your GPS device.  You navigate around the map by walking or
       running, with your feet.</p>
    <p><i>Q:</i> Why isn't my device successfully finding my location?<br />
       <i>A:</i> The Zombie, Run! device needs to know your exact location, and uses the GPS
       position system to determine where you are.  As it is based on satellite signals, GPS works
       best when you have a clear view of a large portion of the sky.  We have found that the
       Zombie, Run! device works best away from tall buildings or overhanging foliage.  Heavy cloud
       cover can also influence the zombie finder's effectiveness.  Urban settings and forested
       areas are some of the more dangerous areas to be in during a zombie infestation, and we
       recommend that you avoid those areas on principle.</p>
